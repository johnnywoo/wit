# WTF is a template engine

 * HTML-oriented
 * As little syntax as possible
 * Easy to write and read
 * Proper context-aware escaping

show-syntax? generates an annotated template in HTML with colored escaping

## Overview

Not so fast! Read the docs while the overview is (not) being written.

 * syntax.md: syntax of statements and expressions
 * commands.md: built-in library of commands
 * extending.md: recommendations on extending WTF and technical details
